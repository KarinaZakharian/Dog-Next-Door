## Project Summary

The project, titled O’Dog Next Door, was executed within a one-month timeframe by a team of four developers, initiated by our product manager, Ilias Yakdane. The site aims to provide a reassuring pet-sitting solution for pet owners during their absences.

### Generosity-based Model

O’Dog Next Door operates on a generosity-based model: users seeking pet-sitting solutions can also offer their own pet-sitting services. Users input their availability on a calendar, along with relevant information about themselves and their pets.

### Search and Selection

A search form allows individuals to find nearby people willing to offer services on specified dates. The site presents the results in two sections: a list of candidates with distances and their locations on a map. Users can then make their choice.

### Development Stack

- **Front-end:** React, Redux Toolkit (state management), Axios (communication with the back-end), TypeScript, Leaflet (for mapping).
- **Back-end:** Express, PostgreSQL, Node.js.
- **Address Auto-completion:** Integrated the api.gouv API.

### User-friendly Platform

The result is a meticulously developed, user-friendly platform that simplifies the lives of pet owners while fostering a caring community of animal enthusiasts.

## Quick Start Guide for Website Setup

To launch the website's front-end, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal and enter `npm i` to install the necessary dependencies.
2. Run `npm run dev` to initiate the front-end development server.

For the back-end setup:

1. Navigate to the 'back' directory using `cd back`.
2. Execute `npm install` to install the required back-end dependencies.
3. Run one of our scripts, 'deploy_db.sh,' using `bash` to set up the database.
4. Don't forget to run `npm start` after completing the above steps.

This straightforward guide ensures a smooth and efficient setup process for both the front and back parts of the website.
